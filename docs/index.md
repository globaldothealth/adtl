adtl is a data transformation language (DTL) used by some applications in
[Global.health](https://global.health), notably for the ISARIC clinical data pipeline at
[globaldothealth/isaric](https://github.com/globaldothealth/isaric).

**adtl is currently a prototype and is subject to major revisions**

## Motivation

Most existing data transformation languages are usually in a XML dialect, though
there are recent variations in other file formats. In addition, many DTLs use a
custom domain specific language. The primary utility of this DTL is to provide a
easy to use library in Python for basic data transformations, which are
specified in a JSON file. It is not meant to be a comprehensive, and adtl can
be used as a step within a larger data processing pipeline.
